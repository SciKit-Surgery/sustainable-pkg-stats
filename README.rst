This is a set of scripts to get statistics on the scikit-surgery library
and turn them into a nice webpage

Sustainability dashboard template for community
================================================

We provide a repository template for creating a sustainability dashboard for your own library/ecosystem of interest.
It automatically creates the scripts and files needed to run the analysis needed for deployment of dashboard
showing metrics of libraries existing within a given base Python package/ecosystem.
It includes the Github Action that deploys the produced html files to the `gh-pages` branch of a target repository,
which triggers a deployment every 12 hours, using the `cron` scheduler.

Using the template
==================

1. You can use your preferred virtual python envirohment to install `cookieninja <https://libraries.io/pypi/cookieninja>`__.

.. code-block::

    pip install cookieninja

For instance, you can create conda or mamba environment with basic packages as follows

.. code-block::

    conda create -n susdbVE pip cookieninja -c conda-forge
    conda activate susdbVE


2. Run cookieninja in the desired location

.. code-block::

    cookieninja gh:scikit-surgery/sustainable-pkg-stats

If you have this repo locally (this may be the case if you are developing, or you cloned this repository before), you can alternatively run the following:

.. code-block::

    cookieninja /path/to/your/checkout/of/python-template

3. A series of questions will pop up to configure the project.
Type the answer or hit return to use the default option (shown in square brackets).
Note that these project variables are defined in the `cookiecutter.json` file.
It is important that you enter a value for `base_library_name` as the dashboard analysis scripts will be configured for this base package.
There is a script the cookieninja runs placed under `hooks/pre_gen_project.py` that checks if the name given returns package entries in pypi search.

.. code-block::

    author_name [John Smith]:
    author_email [temp@gmail.com]:
    project_name [Community Dashboard]:
    project_slug [dashboard_for_scikit-surgery]:
    base_library_name [scikit-surgery]:
    project_short_description [A dashboard template from scikit-surgery]:
    funder [JBFC: The Joe Bloggs Funding Council]:
    Select licence:
    1 - MIT
    2 - BSD-3
    3 - GPL-3.0
    Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]:


4. This will create a directory with the following configuration:
For example, for a project with the following variables:

.. code-block::

    project_name : Community Dashboard
    base_library_name : scikit-surgery

We will get a project folder named after `dashboard_for_scikit-surgery`, structured like this:

.. code-block::

    └── update_pypi_stats.py



Important configurations to note:

1. `get_github_repos.py` and `get_pypi_repos.py` will take `base_library_name` as the base name to search packages in `https://pypi.org/search/` and github

2. `project_name` will appear in the README.md as the human-readable name of the project.

3. `html/dashboard.html` will take `project_name` as the main title, Community Dashboard, and also use `project_slug` for a description below the logo, as shown below:

.. image:: assets/header_cookieninja_template.png
   :width: 400
   :alt: Dashboard header for the given example

5. Create a new repository with the same `project_slug` name (e.g. `https://github.com/$GITHUB_USER_ID/dashboard_for_scikit-surgery`).

6. To run the analysis scripts, test locally, you need a personal access token for Github API generated from `here <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>`__
Save it in the base directory under a text file named `github.token`

7. Few [optional] things to set before you can run the pipeline!

a. You can specify a list for the libraries you want to exclude from your dashboard deployment, under `libraries/exclusions`

    Similar to `libraries` folder, this (as shown below) has a dict entry for each package, such as in this example from `scikit-surgery`:
        | libraries/exclusions
        | ├── scikit-surgeryoverlay
        | ├── scikit-surgerytorsosimulator
        | └── scikit-surgeryvideoutils

    Each file entry (ex. scikit-surgeryoverlay) is a `.json` file that has :
    an `obsolete` key and a value that is a sentence describing why they are obsolete, such as:
    ```{"obsolete" : "Became <a href='https://github.com/UCL/scikit-surgeryvtk'>sikit-surgeryvtk.</a>"}```

b. You can save the logo of your base package (a .svg file) under `assets/logo-dashboard.svg` for it to show up in your deployment header

8. Github Configurations
a. You need to initialise github pages in your repository and set the deployment source from branch `gh-pages`:   
Github Action will automatically initialise this branch and deploy from here. 
You can find the instructions `here <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site>`__

You might need admin rights from your organisation to use your organisation's base name. You can also use your username as the domain.

Your configuration will need to look like this (In the example below, our domain name is the `scikit-surgery` organisation):

.. image:: assets/github_pages_configuration.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: Configuration

b. You need a secret personal token to use the github API in the Github Action workflow, saved as `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. For this you
will need admin rights in your organisation and repository. You can read more on secret Github tokens
`here <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets>`__

    1. Go to the `Settings`
    2. Go to `Security and variables` -> Actions -> Repository secrets
    3. Add a key named `GITHUB_TOKEN` and the token you created at step 6.

    This is the same type of token you saved locally in Step 6. Yo should never
    version control/track this token in your remote repository,  so here we are creating
    a field for it which Github Action can reference in deployment.

9. Setting github repository.
Push your first commit to your package repository

.. code-block::

    cd dashboard_for_scikit-surgery
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin git@github.com:$GITHUB_USER_ID/dashboard_for_scikit-surgery.git
    git push -u origin main


10. Running the pipeline

The Github Actions workflow will run this pipeline, so you do not need to do anything.

Locally, you can check if the pipeline works correctly, by running the python scripts ordered and referenced in the `Makefile` file of this repository.
Note for checking if things work properly.
While running `get_badges.py` you should notice that under `libraries` folder, there are .json files of dictionary entries for each package.
